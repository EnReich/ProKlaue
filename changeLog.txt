Known Issues/TODO:
   - No Downwards compatibility for Maya 2017 and lower
   - Rework UI (show currently selected object(s), progress, info-messages, remove deprecated elements, etc.)

Update 0.3.5:
    - compatibility for Maya 2019

Update 0.3.4:
    - added scripts to calculate Joint Axes on principal curvature directions
    - added scripts to parse a tek pressure data file and calculate outline of imprint
    - both uses sklearn

Update 0.3.3:
    - new commands: cmds.projectionArea, cmds.overlapStatistic
    - vhacd: use new build which exports results in a obj sequence, for the moment does not delete the temporary result files
    - intersection: add an option to give the result in a matlab formatted string which can be easier reimported using np.matrix(res)
    - vhacd/intersection: use os.path.abspath to get a path in a windows/linux style format, use executable option of Popen for platform stability     

Update 0.3.2:
    - fixed a bug: normalize AxisPlane when executing altitudeMap

Update 0.3.1:
   - new command: cmds.coordinateSystem
   - small non-functional fixes (string optimization)
   - exportData: additional flag in UI to switch between automatic coordinate system (normalized position) and arbitrary coordinate system (as transform node grouped under object) as base for all export data
   - coordinateSystem: bug fix and reuse of materials
   - new function: misc.getTriangleEdges

Update 0.3.0:
   - new command: cmds.altitudeMap
   - Button for altitudeMap data export directly from UI of axisParallelPlane
   - axisParallelPlane: transform will not be frozen
   - axisParallelPlane: use centroids of each triangle as points instead of the vertices (to be consistent with altitudeMap distance)
   - axisParallelPlane: object is set as parent of calculated plane
   - altitudeMap: plane needs to be grouped under object and altitude information is exported with plane fixed at bone
   - exportData: keyframe used to determine alignment is set to first frame of animation (time > 0) of given object and its possible parent joint
   - small change in misc.getFaceNormals: matrix-matrix multiplication instead of vector-matrix multiplication

Update 0.2.9:
   - new command: cmds.axisParallelPlane
   - added flag "worldSpace" in misc.getPoints and misc.getFaceNormals: return world space (with transform, default) or local space (without transform) vertices; changed cmds.eigenvector to use local space vertices to ensure correct alignment
   - normalize, exportData and centerPoint will now use world space coordinates (instead of local space)
   - bug-fix in cmds.eigenvector(): in cases 'xzy'/'zxy' the last axis pointed in wrong direction

Update 0.2.8:
   - changed import mechanism in proKlaue.py (modules will be loaded according to the given command list and during an import error only those modules causing the error are not loaded)
   - New commands only need to be added to list 'kPluginCmdName' (file/module name, class name and command name must be the same! Functions '<cmd>Creator' and '<cmd>SyntaxCreator' must be present!)
   - bug fix in cmds.normalize with axisOrder-Flag
   - new command: cmds.vhacd (approx. convex decomposition using V-HACD library)
   - cmds.intersection now uses convex decompositions to approximate the original objects
   - cmds.intersection raises error if volume of convex decomposition is smaller than volume of object itself
   - introduced new documentation with sphinx

Update 0.2.7:
   - new command: cmds.intersection
   - new classes: intersection_tet_tet and collision_tet_tet
   - minor optimizations in cmds.centerPoint, cmds.findTubeFaces
   - update documentation and code maintenance

Update 0.2.6:
   - new method in misc.py: project (project point p onto vector v)
   - optimization in cmds.rangeObj: use of list comprehension and lambda-expression
   - Bugfix in cmds.eigenvector() l. 101--105: there were cases where the object gets a negative scale value in one axis which influenced the export coordinates. Now the eigenvectors with the two largest eigenvalues will always point towards their positive world axis whereas the third eigenvector will be calculated trough the cross product (right-handed coordinate system)
   - new command: cmds.adjustAxisDirection

Update 0.2.5:
   - command cmds.normalize: screen will be refreshed after normalization of each object
   - fixed cmds.convexHull: all triangle vertices are now defined counterclockwise when frontface is viewed (right-handed orientation)
   - fixed bug in cmds.convexHull where name of created transform node was not correctly returned
   - cmds.exportData: new flag "maintain Offset" to switch between export of hierarchical joint structure (offset = 0) and export of separate objects (offset = 1)
   - new method getFaceNormals in misc.py to parse and return list of face normals for given object
   - new command: cmds.getVolume, cmds.delaunay

HotFix 0.2.4:
   - command cmds.exportData: bugfix in one of the export arguments
   - command cmds.exportData: Axis angles now export angle between world space axis and corresponding local axis

Version 0.2.3:
   - command cmds.getShells: small changes in the calculation of all shells which result in faster execution
   - transfered helper functions from cmds.eigenvector to misc.py
   - added 'centroid' option as method to position an object (weighted mean of triangles area and centroid)
   - new command: cmds.centroidPoint

HotFix 0.2.2:
   - Script "cleanup": deactivated cmds.closeBorder and cmds.triangulate when clicking button "select" (leads to a case where number of face normals is not equal to number of triangles which produces index error in findTubeFaces)

HotFix 0.2.1
   - small bug in cmds.rangeObj fixed
   - Script "cleanup" will now show progress in % for searching shells (percentage of triangles already inside one found shell) and finding tubes (percentage of triangles already evaluated)

Version 0.2.0:
   - General changes of UI for buttons "norm" and "exp"
   - Helper function now in separate file misc.py
   - Additonal checkbox for fast calculation (with convex hull; faster but inaccurate)
   - Button "cleanup" to find all shells of currently selected object. Shells will be listed in textbox and by selecting one shell, the triangles belonging to the shell are marked inside the object (object should be set transparent). Additionally all triangles with an orthogonal distance smaller than a certain threshold can be searched and selected (small tubes connecting two shells)
   - new commands: cmds.cleanup, cmds.convexHull, cmds.findTubeFaces, cmds.getShells, cmds.rangeObj

Initial features:
   - New shelf-tab "ProKlaue" inside Maya
   - Button "norm" for normalization of each selected object (translation to (0,0,0) and orientation with eigenvectors of covariance matrix)
   - Button "exp" for export of position/rotation for each selected object and each time frame in current animation
   - commands: cmds.alignObj, cmds.centerPoint, cmds.normalize, cmds.export, cmds.eigenvector
